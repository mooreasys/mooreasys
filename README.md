- 👋 Hi, I’m @mooreasys AKA Bob Moore.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding as my hobby turned career.  I like the Idea of being a free lance coder working on short projects getting paid a Lot.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that is not how it works in the coding world.  and that I will need a day job as most folks don't really understand the power of the computer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on and change the way common people view the computers.  I want to help people get a clear message and means to exchange things of value.
- 📫 How to reach me, Let's talk I may be able to assist with projects, just to learn to build something that will change the world.
- 🎶 I love working with sound and speaking.  I hope to share what I have learned with others.
